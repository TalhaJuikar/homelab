# üåê My Multi-Cluster Kubernetes Setup with FluxCD

![FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/img/flux-horizontal-color.png)

This repository contains the complete infrastructure-as-code for my personal Kubernetes clusters managed through GitOps with FluxCD. I've built this system to provide a robust, repeatable, and secure environment for running my homelab services and personal projects.

## Introduction

The purpose of my homelab is to learn, experiment, and gain practical experience with modern infrastructure patterns. As a cloud native engineer, I use this setup to test new techniques before implementing them in professional environments. I deliberately chose to build my workload cluster with KubeADM to understand the intricacies of a production-grade Kubernetes setup and deepen my understanding of Kubernetes internals and management processes that are often abstracted away in managed distributions, complemented by Rancher for cluster lifecycle management. Additionally, self-hosting applications gives me complete control over my data while forcing me to think about the entire lifecycle ‚Äì from deployment and security to backup strategies and maintenance. All my clusters use Cilium CNI for networking, which provides eBPF-based networking, security, and observability capabilities.

## üñ•Ô∏è Cluster Architecture

- **Skynet**: A compact three-node RKE2-based management cluster that runs Rancher for fleet management, allowing me to quickly provision and destroy clusters for experimentation
- **Morpheus**: A robust six-node KubeADM-based cluster with highly available control planes, ensuring resilience and optimal performance for application workloads.


## üöÄ Deployed Applications & Services

### Infrastructure Layer

- **Cilium**: eBPF-based CNI for advanced networking, security, and observability
- **Longhorn**: Distributed storage solution providing resilient volumes across my clusters
- **Cert-Manager**: Automatic TLS certificate management for all services
- **External-Secrets**: Securely syncs credentials from Bitwarden to my clusters
- **MetalLB**: Bare metal load balancer that assigns IPs to services on my network
- **Traefik**: Intelligent edge router directing traffic to appropriate services
- **Cloudflare Tunnel**: Secure external access without exposing my home network

### Application Layer

- **Kubernetes Dashboard** : Web UI for visualizing and managing cluster resources
- **Jellyfin** : Media server with dedicated persistent storage for media files and configuration
- **Portfolio Website** : My personal website with automated image updates through Flux. https://talhajuikar.cloud
- **IT-Tools** : Collection of some handy utilities I use for daily operations

### Monitoring Stack

- **Prometheus**: Multiple federated instances collecting metrics across clusters
- **Grafana**: Custom dashboards for monitoring system health and application metrics
- **Loki**: Centralized log aggregation for all applications
- **Promtail**: DaemonSet running on every node to collect and ship logs to Loki

## üîÑ GitOps Implementation

I've fully embraced the GitOps philosophy for managing my infrastructure, with Flux handling all the heavy lifting:

1. **Source Controller**: Watches this Git repository and automatically detects when I push changes
2. **Kustomize Controller**: Applies my Kubernetes manifests with proper overlay resolution
3. **Image Automation Controller**: Automatically updates my container images when new versions are available in my registry
4. **Helm Controller**: Manages my Helm releases declaratively for components like Longhorn and cert-manager

I've structured dependencies between components through careful Kustomization ordering, which has eliminated deployment race conditions that previously caused issues. For example, cert-manager must be fully operational before any IngressRoute resources with TLS can be deployed.

### Automated Image Updates

One of my favorite features is the automated image updates for my portfolio website:

1. The Image Automation Controller watches my container registry for new image tags
2. When a new image is detected, Flux automatically:
   - Updates the manifest in the Git repository
   - Commits the change with a standardized message via the Flux CD Bot
   - Applies the updated deployment to the cluster

This creates a fully automated CI/CD pipeline where building a new container image triggers a complete deployment without any manual intervention.

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow and Operations

### How I Deploy New Applications

When I want to add a new application to my clusters, I follow these steps:

1. I develop the base manifests in `apps/base/<application-name>/`, typically starting with a deployment, service, and ingress
2. I create cluster-specific overlays in `apps/<cluster-name>/<application-name>/` with configuration unique to each environment
3. I add the application reference to the respective cluster's kustomization in `clusters/<cluster-name>/apps.yaml`
4. After committing and pushing changes, Flux automatically applies the new resources to my clusters

For example, when I added the IT-Tools deployment, I created the base configuration in `apps/base/it-tools/` with deployment, service, and ingressroute manifests, then created cluster-specific overlays in `apps/morpheus/it-tools/` with Morpheus-specific configurations.

### How I Manage Infrastructure Changes

Infrastructure changes follow a similar pattern but require more careful planning:

1. I make changes to core components in `infrastructure/base/<component-name>/`
2. I test major changes on the Morpheus cluster first before applying to Skynet
3. I leverage Flux's dependency management to ensure components deploy in the correct order

### My Troubleshooting Approach

When issues arise, here's how I diagnose them:

```bash
# I check the Flux controllers for errors
kubectl logs -n flux-system deployment/source-controller

# I verify the status of my resources
kubectl get kustomizations,helmreleases -A

# I look at cluster events for clues
kubectl get events -A --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

I also heavily rely on my Grafana dashboards to monitor resource usage and performance metrics across all applications.

## üîí Security Approach

Security is a top priority in my setup, and I've implemented several layers of protection:

- **Zero-Trust Architecture**: I use strict RBAC policies that give applications only the permissions they absolutely need
- **Secrets Management**: I store all sensitive data in Bitwarden and retrieve it dynamically via External Secrets Operator, keeping credentials out of Git
- **Network Security**: I expose services exclusively through Cloudflare Tunnels, eliminating the need for open inbound ports
- **GitOps Security**: I've enabled signature verification for my Flux sync operations for integrity validation
- **Encryption**: All persistent volumes containing sensitive data are encrypted at rest

## üíæ Storage Strategy

I use multiple storage solutions based on the specific needs of each application:

- **Longhorn**: Provides distributed block storage for most stateful applications
- **NFS Integration**: External NFS mounts for large media libraries (500GB+ for Jellyfin)
- **Storage Classes**: Different storage classes for different performance requirements
- **Persistent Volumes**: Properly configured with appropriate access modes and retention policies
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular snapshots and off-site backups for critical data

## üîß Networking Setup

My networking architecture is designed for security and isolation:

- **CNI**: Cilium provides eBPF-based networking across all clusters with advanced security features
- **Ingress**: Traefik handles all incoming traffic with proper routing and TLS termination
- **Service Exposure**: Cloudflare Tunnels provide secure external access without opening ports
- **Load Balancing**: MetalLB assigns virtual IPs to services on my internal network
- **Network Policies**: Cilium network policies enforce fine-grained access control between services

## üîë Credential Management

Managing secrets is critical in my setup:

- **External Secrets**: I use External Secrets Operator to fetch sensitive data from Bitwarden
- **Secret Rotation**: Regular rotation of credentials for critical services
- **Sealed Secrets**: For cases where I need to commit encrypted secrets to Git
- **Access Controls**: Fine-grained access controls for all credential stores

## ‚ú® In Production

This repository represents my actual production infrastructure running today:

- **Media Services**: Jellyfin media server with persistent storage for my media library
- **Development Tools**: Kubernetes Dashboard and IT-Tools available across clusters
- **Personal Website**: Portfolio site with automatic image updates via Flux
- **Infrastructure**: Complete observability stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki

Everything is continuously synchronized through FluxCD, giving me a single source of truth and ensuring that my clusters always reflect the state defined in this repository.

## üöÄ Continuous Improvement

I'm constantly evolving this setup as I learn new techniques and technologies. Some of my upcoming plans include:

- Extending my Cilium implementation with advanced network policies
- Setting up automated image vulnerability scanning
- Building a disaster recovery process with Velero
- Implementing more advanced GitOps workflows for application lifecycle management

This repository is a living documentation of my journey with Kubernetes and GitOps. As I continue to refine my approach, I'll update the code here to reflect my current best practices.
